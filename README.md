webrender-puppeteer
===================

Like https://github.com/ukwa/webrender-phantomjs but backed by [Google Puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer).

Note that `npm` can be used to control versioning in `package.json` and tagging.  e.g. `npm version major` for a major version bump. Instead of `major` this can be `minor` or `patch`, i.e. SemVer.

Then a `git push origin master --follow-tags`` should build a suitably tagged release.
